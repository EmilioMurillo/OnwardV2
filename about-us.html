      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>Our PreK - 12 STEAM schools provide students with the analytical and innovative mindset necessary for success in STEAM fields. STEAM is the acronym that specifies a study in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics. The goal of including Arts is to build the creativity muscle that fuels an innovation mindset.
      </p>
      <h2>Aim</h2>
      <p>We aim to increase the number of Black and Latinx students prepared to enter
       science and engineering fields.  Positions in these fields are growing in the greater Boston area, yet only 3 to 4 percent of Black and Latinx workers are currently represented in these fields.  By providing access and opportunities to students in these beloved communities, we incorporate their values and  knowledge into the school space, we will be able to fulfill our goal of socially and economically uplifting our families of color.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Our mission is to create  the learning environment that enables Black and Latinx scholars to build their analytical skills,  innovate, and increase their knowledge of  engineering and scientific practices  in order to  enter STEAM fields.
